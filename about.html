            <p>
                I was born the 16th of August 2001 in Rome, Italy. I grew
                up in a small city near Rome called Riano and I started 
                appreciating science and technologies quite early in my
                life, playing with few consoles and curious on how the worked.
                When I was 10, I got my first computer and there I started fidgeting
                around and play a little.
