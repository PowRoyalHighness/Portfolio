            <p>
                I went to High School in a small city called Civita Castellana
                near Viterbo with the idea of starting to study coding and informatics
                but in the end I studied chemistry, ending up becoming a chemical expert.
                I had a strong interest in the subject and I planned to join university, but 
                I dropped out noticing that I preferred something more coding oriented.
